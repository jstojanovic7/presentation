                My nuclear family consists of my mother, father and older brother. My father is an economist and owns a private company. Mother always took care of all of us and made our lives easier. My brother moved to Vienna with his wife - he's been living there for around 9 years now. He works for an insurance company and pretty much has his life planned out. We are a really tight-knit family. Alongside my girlfriend, this is my biggest support system. <br/><br/>

                Two years ago, I started living with my girlfriend, Lola. We all know she will soon become my wife. She is a fashion photographer and an art director for a popular lifestyle online magazine here in Serbia. We are happy to say we are fully enjoying our lives. <br/><br/>

                I have some other interests and hobbies I'd like to mention : <br/>

                     Aside from acquiring a Masters degree, I am also planning on learning one more language  in the next 5 years. I have my pick on Spanish. Hopefully, it would lead to a life in a Spanish village, with a house pointing right at the sea.
